# DynamicBiomes — Architecture

## 1. Goal

Improve isolation, cognitive locality, and dependency hygiene across the plugin.
This document is design-only: no feature implementation, no runtime behavior changes.

## 2. Layout Principle

DDD-inspired modular monolith:

```text
root package
└── bounded context
    └── capability
        └── architectural layer
```

Layers are used only when a capability needs them. **Do not create empty layer packages preemptively.**

## 3. Dependency Direction

```text

                 └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Rules:

- `pluginruntime` may import all modules, but **only for composition/startup**.
- **No module imports `pluginruntime`.**
- **`biome` and `seasons` must not import feature domains.**
- Feature domains may import upstream vocabulary/ports, but **never upstream infrastructure**.
- Upstream contexts do not depend on downstream contexts.

## 4. Published Language

Downstream feature contexts must consume only explicitly published upstream contracts. Feature domains must not import arbitrary internal packages from `biome` or `seasons`.

### 4.1 What Is Published

- **Biome identity and resolution**: `BiomeId`, `BiomeContext`, `BiomeResolver` port, `UnsupportedBiomeException`.
- **Biome static profile**: `BiomeProfile`, `BiomeProfileProvider` port, `ClimateProfile`, `Humidity`, `Temperature`, `Fertility`, `MineralRichness`, `EcologicalPressure`.
- **Season identity and profile**: `SeasonId`, `CurrentSeasonQuery` port, `SeasonProfile`, `SeasonClimateAdjustment`, `SeasonalAdjustment`, `SeasonProfileProvider` port.
- **Ore drops safety contract**: `UnsupportedOreDropConfigurationException` (thrown when a biome has no ore drop policy or an `OreKind` has no configured rule; caught by `ore/drops/application` to preserve vanilla drops).
- **Spatial vocabulary**: `WorldReference`, `BlockPosition`.

### 4.2 What Is Not Published

- Internal infrastructure packages: `biome/*/infrastructure`, `seasons/*/infrastructure`.
- Internal repository implementations: `BukkitBiomeResolver`.
- Internal configuration parsing details.
- Any package not listed in the published vocabulary above.

### 4.3 Consumption Rules

- Downstream domains may import from `biome/*/domain` and `seasons/*/domain` only for types explicitly listed above.
- Downstream domains must not depend on how `biome` or `seasons` persist or resolve their data.
- If a downstream domain needs a new upstream concept, it must be explicitly added to the published language rather than reaching into internal packages.

## 5. Layer Responsibilities

### 5.1 `domain/`

- Value objects, entities, and aggregates.
- Domain services that encode business rules and invariants.
- Domain events.
- Repository and provider **ports** (interfaces).
- Business rules and invariants live here.

Rules:

- No Bukkit/Paper imports.
- No YAML, file I/O, or database implementation details.
- No runtime framework annotations.
- Lombok compile-time annotations are allowed only for boilerplate reduction and
  invariant enforcement, such as null checks. Domain behavior and invariants
  must remain explicit in the domain model.

### 5.2 `application/`

- Use-case orchestration only.
- Loads inputs, calls domain behavior, saves results, coordinates ports.
- Transactional boundaries (if any) live here.

Rules:

- Must not contain domain rules or invariants.
- Must not import Bukkit events or listeners.
- May import domain types and port interfaces.

### 5.3 `infrastructure/`

- Bukkit/Paper adapters (listeners, tasks, world access).
- YAML parsing, file I/O, persistence adapters.
- Framework-specific configuration loading.
- Translation between framework types and domain value objects at boundaries.

Rules:

- Implements domain ports; does not define them.
- May import Bukkit, Paper, SnakeYAML, and file I/O libraries.

### 5.4 `presentation/` (optional)

- Commands, admin UI, menus, user-facing adapters.
- Use only when a capability has player-facing interaction.

Rules:

- Do not create empty `presentation/` packages.
- Must not contain domain logic.

## 6. Shared Kernel: Spatial

`spatial` is **not** a full bounded context. It is a Shared Kernel containing pure, reusable spatial vocabulary.

Responsibilities:

- Owns value objects: `WorldReference`, `BlockPosition`, `ChunkPosition`, `EcologicalRegionId`.
- Must own **no gameplay behavior**.
- Must own **no persistence decisions**.
- Must import **no Bukkit types**.
- May use Lombok compile-time annotations under the same restrictions as domain
  packages.

Bukkit `Location` is translated into these value objects at infrastructure boundaries. Other contexts may freely import from `spatial` because it is a shared kernel, not a downstream dependency.

## 7. Anti-Coupling Rules

- `biome` must not contain ore, crop, tree, or animal vocabulary.
- `seasons` must not reference `biome`.
- Feature domains combine `biome` + `seasons` + feature-specific policy at calculation time.
- Dynamic biome/ecological state must describe **environmental conditions**, not feature-specific behavior.

Forbidden inside `biome/dynamics` or `biome/profile`:

```java
// Forbidden
oreMultiplier
cropGrowthSpeed
animalDeathChance
treeSpreadChance
```

Acceptable inside `biome/profile`:

```java
// Acceptable
ClimateProfile
Humidity
Temperature
Fertility
MineralRichness
EcologicalPressure
```

Do **not** introduce `BiomeEffect`, `EffectType`, or any biome-owned rule vocabulary such as `ORE_DROP_MULTIPLIER`.

Configuration files must be split by ownership:

- `biome-profiles.yml` belongs to `biome/profile`
- `season-profiles.yml` belongs to `seasons/profile`
- `ore-drops.yml` belongs to `ore/drops`

Raw YAML must not leak into domain. Bukkit types must not leak into domain.

### 8.1 Spatial Value Objects

Replace generic `WorldPosition` with explicit spatial value objects:

- `WorldReference` — pure Java representation of a world; prefer UUID for identity; may carry name for diagnostics.
- `BlockPosition` — world + int x + int y + int z; used for block events and biome resolution.

Additional spatial value objects (`ChunkPosition`, `EcologicalRegionId`) should not be implemented until used. Bukkit `Location` is translated into these VOs at infrastructure boundaries.

### 8.2 Biome Read Model

`BiomeContext` is the single read model for resolved biome/environment information.

It combines:

- `BiomeId` — the identity of the resolved biome.
- `BiomeProfile` — static or configured ecological properties for that biome type.

There is no separate `ResolvedBiome`. `BiomeResolver` returns `BiomeContext`.

Dynamic state must not contain ore, crop, or animal rule results.

### 8.3 Ore Origin Separate from Ore Drops

- `ore/origin` owns origin state and origin persistence (`OreOrigin`, `OreOriginRepository`).
- `PaperOrePlaceListener` lives in `ore/origin/infrastructure`.
- `ore/drops` consumes ore origin data but does not own origin tracking.
- `OreOrigin` uses pure domain types only; no Bukkit imports.

## 9. Value Object Rules

- **No empty wrappers.** A value object must carry meaningful, validated data.
- **Validate construction invariants.** IDs cannot be null or blank. Namespaced keys must be valid. Coordinate objects must use explicit integer block/chunk/region semantics.
- **Records are appropriate** for immutable value objects (`BiomeId`, `BlockPosition`, `SeasonId`, etc.).
- **Entities/aggregates should not be passive records** unless immutability and all transition methods are explicitly modeled.
- **Equality is by value** for value objects, by identity for entities.

## 11. Persistence and Configuration Are Infrastructure

### 11.1 Persistence

Persistence is infrastructure, not a bounded context. The domain that owns the state owns the repository port.

State repository ports live inside the owning domain/capability:

```text
ore/origin/domain/OreOriginRepository.java
seasons/cycle/domain/SeasonStateRepository.java
```

Persistence adapters implement those ports:

```text
ore/origin/infrastructure/YamlOreOriginRepository.java
seasons/cycle/infrastructure/YamlSeasonStateRepository.java
```

Shared persistence utilities, if needed, are technical support infrastructure only. There is no generic snapshot/repository abstraction; each domain owns its own repository port.
Persistence format is an implementation detail, not a domain boundary.

### 11.2 Configuration

Configuration is infrastructure, not a bounded context. Each feature/environmental context owns its own typed configuration interpretation.

Typed providers per capability:

```text
biome/profile/infrastructure/YamlBiomeProfileProvider.java
ore/drops/infrastructure/YamlOreDropPolicyProvider.java
seasons/profile/infrastructure/YamlSeasonProfileProvider.java
```

Shared YAML loading/parsing utilities, if needed, are infrastructure support only. There is no generic `ConfigurationProvider` port in domain. Raw YAML is translated into typed domain objects at infrastructure boundaries.

## 12. Port-Adapter Naming Convention

Not every port is a repository. Use naming that reflects responsibility:

| Pattern | Use For | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Repository** | Persisted collections of domain objects or mutable state | `OreOriginRepository` |
| **Provider** | Configured policy/profile data | `OreDropPolicyProvider`, `BiomeProfileProvider`, `SeasonProfileProvider` |
| **Resolver** | Mapping one concept to another | `BiomeResolver` maps `BlockPosition` to `BiomeContext` |

## 13. Domain Events

Domain events are allowed for cross-context reactions.

Appropriate uses:

- `SeasonTransitioned` — downstream domains react to season changes.

Rules:

- Do **not** force event-driven architecture for synchronous Minecraft actions such as block breaking or entity damage.
- Synchronous feature evaluation may still query published upstream ports directly.
- Events must be plain data objects; no Bukkit types.
- Publish from domain; subscribe in application or infrastructure layers.

## 14. Public Plugin API

Avoid a god `DynamicBiomesApi`.

- **Prefer no public API** until a real external plugin integration use case exists.
- If a central API remains under `pluginruntime/api`, it must be **thin**, contain **no domain logic**, and delegate to context-specific capabilities.
- Public API types must be stable, versioned, and part of the published language.
- Public API must not expose internal repository implementations, YAML details, or Bukkit types to consumers.

## 15. Module-Boundary Enforcement

Enforce boundaries in phases:

- **Phase 1 — Package conventions plus documented import rules.**
  - Follow the layer responsibilities in Section 5.
  - No downstream imports of upstream `infrastructure`.
  - No imports of `pluginruntime` from other modules.
  - Document exceptions explicitly.

- **Phase 2 — ArchUnit-style tests.**
  - Add tests that assert forbidden imports (e.g., `domain` must not import `org.bukkit`, downstream must not import upstream `infrastructure`).
  - Run as part of the normal test suite.

- **Phase 3 — Gradle subprojects (only if the project grows).**
  - Consider Gradle subprojects with explicit `api`/`implementation` dependencies if the codebase exceeds ~50k lines or if independent release cycles are needed.
  - Do **not** require Gradle subprojects immediately.

## 16. Test Package Parity

Tests mirror source package structure:

```text
src/main/java/biome/resolution/domain/BiomeContext.java
src/test/java/biome/resolution/domain/BiomeContextTest.java
```

Rules:

- Domain tests must not require Bukkit, YAML, or file I/O.
- Use in-memory fakes/stubs for providers, repositories, resolvers, and queries.
- Example: `InMemoryBiomeProfileProvider`, `InMemoryOreOriginRepository`.
- Infrastructure tests may use Bukkit mocks or temporary files where appropriate.
- Application tests use real domain objects with stubbed ports.

## 17. Presentation Layer Is Optional

Use `presentation/` only when a capability has commands, admin GUI, public UI, or other presentation-specific adapters.

Good:

```text
ore/drops/
├── domain/
├── application/
└── infrastructure/
```

Add `presentation/` only when needed. Do not create empty layer packages preemptively.

## 18. Implemented Runtime and Deferred Work

### 18.1 Implemented Runtime Behavior

The following capabilities are wired in `pluginruntime/lifecycle/infrastructure/DynamicBiomes` and active at runtime:

- **Ore origin tracking**: `PaperOrePlaceListener` records player-placed ore; `PaperOreBreakListener` clears origin on break; `PaperOreMovementListener` transfers tracked origin across piston movement.
- **Ore drop behavior**: `PaperOreBreakListener` delegates to `OreDropService`, which resolves the biome, looks up the ore drop policy, applies the base multiplier, and applies an optional ore-owned seasonal multiplier factor from `ore-drops.yml` based on the cached current season.
- **YAML-backed configuration**: `YamlBiomeProfileProvider`, `YamlOreDropPolicyProvider`, `YamlSeasonProfileProvider`, and `YamlSeasonCycleSettingsProvider` load configured profiles, policies, and cycle settings at startup.
- **Current season initialization**: `SeasonInitializationService` validates any persisted current season against `SeasonCalendar`, initializes the first season if none exists, and `CachedCurrentSeasonQuery` keeps the runtime season in memory for hot-path reads.
- **Configured season advancement**: `DynamicBiomes` reads `season-cycle.yml`; when `advancement.enabled` is true, it schedules a single repeating `SeasonAdvancementTask` that advances the persisted season through `SeasonCalendar`.
- **Current season command**: `/dynamicbiomes season` reads the cached `CurrentSeasonQuery` and reports the current `SeasonId`.
- **Ore origin persistence**: `YamlOreOriginRepository` lazily loads origin state into memory and writes updates back to disk.

### 18.2 Implemented Safety Behavior

- **Silk Touch bypass**: `PaperOreBreakListener` detects when the broken ore would drop itself (Silk Touch) and skips `OreDropService`, preserving vanilla drops.
- **Unsupported configuration fallback**: `OreDropService` catches `UnsupportedBiomeException` and `UnsupportedOreDropConfigurationException` and returns the vanilla quantity, so unsupported biomes, missing policies, and missing ore rules do not suppress vanilla drops.
- **Real failures still propagate**: malformed YAML, I/O failures, invalid numeric values, invalid namespaced IDs, duplicate keys, and programming errors are not swallowed by the fallback.
- **Persisted season validation**: `SeasonInitializationService` throws `IllegalStateException` if a persisted `SeasonId` is absent from the configured `SeasonCalendar`.
- **Origin cache safety**: `YamlOreOriginRepository` loads once and serves subsequent reads from memory; save/remove still persist.

### 18.3 Still-Deferred Work

The following are intentionally not implemented or not wired at runtime:

- Season effects on crops/trees/animals (season profile data is loaded but not consumed by those feature domains).
- Ecological region state and dynamic biome state.
- Admin commands, public API, or configuration reload commands.
- Database persistence.
- Broader gameplay balancing beyond the current ore drop multiplier.

## 19. Preserved Principles

- `biome` is not a god/master domain.
- `biome` owns biome identity, resolution, profile, and plugin-owned ecological state.
- `seasons` is separate and orthogonal to `biome`.
- Feature domains such as `ore`, `crops`, `trees`, and `animals` interpret environmental context into behavior.
- Domain packages must not import Bukkit/Paper APIs.
- Bukkit, YAML, file I/O, database, and plugin lifecycle code belong outside domain.
